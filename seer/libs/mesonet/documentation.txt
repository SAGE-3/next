/mesonet/db/measurements
type: GET
query fields:
station_ids (optional): A comma separated list of four digit station IDs to be retrieved (e.g. 0115).
start_date (optional): An ISO 8601 formatted date string representing the earliest date to return records from.
end_date (optional): An ISO 8601 formatted date string representing the latest date to return records from.
var_ids (optional): A comma separated list of variable IDs to be retrieved.
intervals (optional): a comma separated list of variable data intervals in seconds to be retrieved. This will limit the variables returned to variables measured at the specified intervals.
flags (optional): A comma separated list of data flag values to be retrieved
location (optional): The mesonet location to retrieve data for, hawaii or american_samoa. Default value: hawaii
limit (optional): The maximum number of records to be retrieved. This value cannot be greater than 1000000 (one million). Values less than 1 will be set to the maximum value. Default value: 10000.
For "wide" row modes, the number of returned rows will be less than or equal to the provided limit. The limit will be applied to individual records, so the real number of rows will be between limit/n and limit where n is the number of variables included in the query. The number of rows will be limit/n in the case where every variable has a record for every timestamp, and limit where exactly 1 variable has a record for every timestamp. Please scale your limit accordingly to get more rows in a single query. when using these modes.
offset (optional): How many records to offset the result by. This can be combined with the limit parameter to retrieve large groups of data in chunks.
For "wide" row modes, the offset will be applied to individual records and the number of rows offset will be less than or equal to the offset provided. See the description in the limit option.
reverse (optional): By default values will be sorted by timestamp starting with the most recent value. Passing a value to this parameter will reverse the order of the data so the oldest values are returned first.
join_metadata (optional): If a value is provided for this parameter, station and variable metadata will be included in each row. For "wide" row modes only station metadata will be included.
local_tz (optional): If a value is provided for this parameter, returned dates will be converted to the timezone local to the mesonet location
row_mode (optional): 
array
The query will return a column index and data as a 2D array.
wide_array
The query will return a column index and data as a 2D array. Rows will be grouped by station and timestamp with variables as columns. Queries can still be limited by flag value, but the flag values will not be returned in this mode. Variable metadata will not be returned in this mode.
json
The query will return an array of JSON objects representing each row of data keyed by column names.
wide_json
The query will return an array of JSON objects representing each row of data keyed by column names. Rows will be grouped by station and timestamp with variables as columns. Queries can still be limited by flag value, but the flag values will not be returned in this mode. Variable metadata will not be returned in this mode.
returns:
row_mode = "array" OR row_mode = "wide_array":
A JSON object with the keys "index" and "data". Where "index" is an array of the data column names and "data" an array of records with columns in the order indicated by the index.
else:
An array of JSON objects records keyed by the column name.
